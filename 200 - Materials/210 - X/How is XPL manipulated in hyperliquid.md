# How is XPL manipulated in hyperliquid

XPL was lanuched in pre-market in hyperliquid, and some attacker manipulated the price to make huge profit. I think this was only possible in pre-market because there is no external reference price, and the funding rate mechanism doesn't work. Once the attacker control the order book, he coild easily wipe out all his counterparties. In pre-market, longs generally have advantage over shorts, so the shorts cannot pour in infinite money to fight with longs.

Why the attacker chose XLP? I think there are many shorts are just to hedge, and they are the target of the attacker.
