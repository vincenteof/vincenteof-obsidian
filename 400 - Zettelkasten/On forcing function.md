# On forcing function

The most brutual way to reduce risk is to set up forcing function which keeps raising bottom line. This way, low-bottom, high-risk situations are filtered out by default and can never even get close to you.

A forcing function is a system that takes a long-term, overwhelming problem and breaks it down into short-term, actionable tasks. It transforms a large, unbearable pain into smaller, manageable pains you can handle in the moment.
