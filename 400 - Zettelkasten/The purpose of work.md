# The purpose of work

Work only makes sense when it compounds your life.  
If you’re merely trading time for money, you should start looking for a smarter way.  
The ultimate goal of life is to gain richer experiences — and that requires both time and freedom.  
That’s why we must build systems that generate cash flow even while we sleep, and engage in compound work that gradually wins our time back to explore the world.
