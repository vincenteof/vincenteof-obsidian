# Pendle Boros

YU is Boros is very like YT, If you long YU you are longing the funding rate, and vice versa.
YU only has a maturity date, the price of YU will become zero at maturity date.

What's different here is: 
1. when you long YU, you pay fixed but receive underlying
2. when you short YU, you pay underlying but received fixed
It means that whether we are longing or shorting, we all receive some interests and pay some interests.



some strategy:
