# The Financial Trick OpenAI Plays

OpenAI buy AMD GPU and stock options from AMD with zero-cash mode.
If the price is up to 600, OpenAI will get a lot of reward and the purchased GPU is almost free. It seems AMD raise money using future orders to OpenAI and let OpenAI buy their chips.
If the price or project progress doesn't go as expected, OpenAI has more flexibility. AMD will use real money to produce GPUs. If OpenAI doesn't purchase, they must find a way
