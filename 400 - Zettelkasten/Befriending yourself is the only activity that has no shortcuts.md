# Befriending yourself is the only activity that has no shortcuts

I think befriending yourself is another way of describing self-acceptance. Most people don't really know who they are, they make decisions based on the identity that society assigns they, which I believe is the root cause of most pain in life. It's like trying to play a card game without knowing what cards you’re holding, or attempting to solve a math problem without first understanding the prerequisites.

So don't play tricks. Be brave, be honst and face who you truly are. As Joyce said: “Think you’re escaping and run into yourself. Longest way round is the shortest way home.”
