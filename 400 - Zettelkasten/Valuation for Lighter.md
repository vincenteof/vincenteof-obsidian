# Valuation for Lighter

- [x] valuation for lighter point #active âœ… 2025-09-09

Point value = FDV * Airdrop Percentage * / Total Points

For Airdrop Percentage, its between  15% to 50%, 30% is fair.
250000 points is distributed each week, so if TGE happens in Q4, total points is in 10M to 12.5M.

So again the key factor is FDV. Hyperliquid is a good reference. Its FDV is about 47B. If its FDV is 2B, about 1/20 of hyperliquid, the point value becomes about 50. But this seems the highest expectation of the community.
Since Lighter doesn't have fee on retail, so OI and TVL may be better metric than trading valume. For these metrics, Hyperliquid is about 14.5 times to Lighter.
Lighter also has some common infra for ZK, it maybe be more competitive when Ethereum comes to ZK era. The bridgeless architecture is lightweighted and maybe bettern than hyperliquid.
Another valuation is based on assumption that all the fees flow into llp and 70% of the llp return comes from fee. If Lighter remains same Fees/FDV ratios as HL, that implies FDV = $5.69B or $142 per lighter point.
We confirm that the first round of airdrop will be 25% ~ 30%.
Another way of evaluation is comparing lighter to robinhood, since they are all zero fee to retail. At the end of Q2, Robinhood's valuation was $83 billion, and crypto trading is 30% of robinhood's revenue (about $160 million for Q2, about 640 million an annualized basis). So we can estimate the added value the crypto market provides to Robinhood, is $24.6 billion by the end of Q2 2025. Lighter's annual revenue is currently $274 million, so it's valuation could be 42% * $24.6B = 10.5B. The price of 1 Point would be $264.
The last time lighter get fund it was valued at 1.5B, and 

Lighter also airdrops memecoins. We can assume the total points are 10M, and the total supply for the meme coin is 1B, and half of it airdrops to points, so each point get 0.5B / 10M = 50 tokens. 

The long term story is that, ethereum is the chain has the best liquidity. As an L2, lighter is able to take defi primitive (like LP token) as collateral to open position with the lp token still earning fees.
