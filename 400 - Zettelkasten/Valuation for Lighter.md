# Valuation for Lighter

## Valuation
- [x] valuation for lighter point #active ✅ 2025-09-09

Point value = FDV * Airdrop Percentage * / Total Points

For Airdrop Percentage, its between  15% to 50%, 30% is fair.
250000 points is distributed each week, so if TGE happens in Q4, total points is in 10M to 12.5M.

So again the key factor is FDV. Hyperliquid is a good reference. Its FDV is about 47B. If its FDV is 2B, about 1/20 of hyperliquid, the point value becomes about 50. But this seems the highest expectation of the community.
Since Lighter doesn't have fee on retail, so OI and TVL may be better metric than trading valume. For these metrics, Hyperliquid is about 14.5 times to Lighter.
Lighter also has some common infra for ZK, it maybe be more competitive when Ethereum comes to ZK era. The bridgeless architecture is lightweighted and maybe bettern than hyperliquid.
Another valuation is based on assumption that all the fees flow into llp and 70% of the llp return comes from fee. If Lighter remains same Fees/FDV ratios as HL, that implies FDV = $5.69B or $142 per lighter point.
We confirm that the first round of airdrop will be 25% ~ 30%.
Another way of evaluation is comparing lighter to robinhood, since they are all zero fee to retail. At the end of Q2, Robinhood's valuation was $83 billion, and crypto trading is 30% of robinhood's revenue (about $160 million for Q2, about 640 million an annualized basis). So we can estimate the added value the crypto market provides to Robinhood, is $24.6 billion by the end of Q2 2025. Lighter's annual revenue is currently $274 million, so it's valuation could be 42% * $24.6B = 10.5B. The price of 1 Point would be $264.
The last time lighter get fund it was valued at 1.5B and most good project will get a 1~10x FDV when TGE (Actually there many project's TGE FDV is over 10x, but since vc based project is not preferred in 2025, some's FDV is less then 1x). I think the OTC price (100u) is very fair.

Lighter also airdrops memecoins. We can assume the total points are 10M, and the total supply for the meme coin is 1B, and half of it airdrops to points, so each point get 0.5B / 10M = 50 tokens. 

假设总量为 1B，如果空投比例为 25％，则空投总数为 0.25B，目前总积分为 12M，1 积分大约 20.83 个币。
Funders Fund 最后一轮以 1.5B 估值投资，这个估值一个单币价格为 1.5U，1分约31.245U。
场外 1M 单子的买入价为 80U/分，单币价格为 3.84U，估值 3.84B。
1.5U/Token -> 31.245U/Point -> 1.5B Valuation
3.0U/Token -> 62.5U/Point -> 3B Valuation
4.0U/Token -> 83.32U/Point -> 4B Valuation
5.0U/Token -> 104.15U/Point -> 5B Valution
8.0U/Token -> 166.64U/Point -> 8B Valution
10.0/Token -> 208.3U/Point -> 10B Valution

Lighter 和 Hyperliquid 讲的是不一样的故事。Hyperliquid 针对追求自由的散户，Lighter 更像是作为 TradeFi & Fintech 的 Infrastructure Layer。
1.5B FDV 的价格作为 VC 设立的基准，4.2B 作为场外 OTC 及 pre-market 交易出来的结果。
如果用 5倍 TVL 估值，那么是 7.2B。作为对比，HL 是 5.8倍，Aster 是 4.2 倍。因此这并不是一个特别离谱的估值。
如果用收入估值，年收入 HL 为 900M，Aster 为 513M，Lighter 为 167.9M。这方面 Lighter 确实逊色于前两者，但是毕竟 Lighter 产品形态未完全且还没有 token。
Bear：1.5B - 4.2B
Base: 4.2B - 7.5B
Bull: 7.5B - 12.5B+

## Big Story
The long term story is that, ethereum is the chain has the best liquidity. As an L2, lighter is able to take defi primitive (like LP token) as collateral to open position with the lp token still earning fees.

- [x] conclude things related to citadel and robinhood #active ✅ 2025-11-18
Founder of lighter has deep relationship of tradfi (citadel and robinhood). If RWA happens, lighter maybe the venue where big funds hedge and trade. It will not just be robinhood integrating lighter. every broker that leans on citadel for liquidity has a huge incentive to line up with the same margin rail for capital efficiency and risk consistency.

Lighter 可能会成为 Robinhood 的一个后端接受从那边路由过来的订单，Robinhood 本身也是 Lighter 的 VC，本身也在押注 Lighter。

HL 上线了 pre ipo 股票的 perp，比如 OPENAI-USDH。因为没有现货价格，因此他们采用的是所内订单簿上的移动平均价格最为预言机价格进行费率机制。这本质上是带了杠杆的预测市场，是被严格监管的，因为风险很大，价格非常容易被操纵。

## Long-term Milestone
Forex and commodities are already supported on Lighter. Next is spot market. And prediction market and option are also in the plan.

2026 Expansion：
- ZK EVM
- RWA Perps
- RWA Spot
- Portfolio Margin
- Mobile App
- Prediction Markets
- S3 / Tokenomics
- …and more

## Token Economics
从简版的说明来看：
1. 协议收入全部分配给持有者，具体形式kennel是回购或分红
2. 质押以获得访问权限
3. 获取市场数据的费用代币
