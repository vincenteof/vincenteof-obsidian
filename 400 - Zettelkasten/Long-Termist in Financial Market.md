# Long-Termist in Financial Market

In Financial market, no matter how many chances you have missed, you are always open to change your fate as long as you are still on the table.
Not making big money doesn't mean you have lost the game, it just means you are still paying tuition in the learning journey.
Money in infinite but time is limited. The true winner is who lives a long and happy life.
