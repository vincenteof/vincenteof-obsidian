# Don't die for optimization

People are always optimizing their strategy for better peformance. But you must be sure what you are not raising your risk level. Some people are just giving up redundancy for optimzation, and it's very dangerous in long term.  Long Tail risk is not predictable, and the reason why you are still alive maybe just luck. The fattest turkey is still celebrating its “optimal survival strategy” the day before Thanksgiving. Don't die for optimization.
