# Huma YT farming plan

Some calculation:
1 PST = 1.04 U
Huma YT has 10% underlying apy
Huma YT has 2X points
It matures at 10/29, 56 days reamaining


At current 11% IY:
100 PST -> 6200 YT
base yield = 6200 * 10% / 365 * 56 = 95.12 PST
feather yield = 6200 * 0.0666 * 56 = 23123 feathers

According to S1, 23.87 feathers converts to 1 huma,
feature yield = 23123 / 23.87 = 968.7 huma = 968.72 * 0.0243 = 23.54u

So total yield =  122.46 U, yield rate = 18%
And $HUMA is also at its local bottom, if the price raise, the yield raise sharply
