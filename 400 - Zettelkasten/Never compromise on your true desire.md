# Never compromise on your true desire

When you’re in a state of perplexity, stay away from cheap dopamine and allow yourself to be bored.  
Curiosity only emerges when you’re bored enough.

When curiosity arises, you don’t need to force focus. Instead, follow whatever makes you feel deeply engaged—even addicted. This phase marks your entry into **intensity**.

This is the most fulfilling stage. You’ve found something that fully absorbs you, where 12-hour workdays happen effortlessly. You enter the **flow state** frequently, and this is the only period when exponential growth truly occurs.

The final stage is **consistency**. It keeps your momentum steady and integrates your achievements into your daily life—like taking profits in stock trading. Once stability is established, you can begin the cycle again, paving the way for another round of exponential growth.
