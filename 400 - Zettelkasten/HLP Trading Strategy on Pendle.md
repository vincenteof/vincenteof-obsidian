# HLP Trading Strategy on Pendle

On platform like HL, the vault are printing money when the market dumps. (By the way, the reason why lighter's llp perform bad is that the vault prioritizes to take the liquidation position and adl.)
When a 10% daily yield spike, we can hold YT to maximize the profit. The key is to calculate the expected yield distributions based on the income of HLP and its TVL. You should always assume that you cannot sell you YT at a higher price.
We can find TVL and PNL on HLP main page. We can also use defilemma and dune to verify the data.
It's very like to buy the option to long the volatility.
