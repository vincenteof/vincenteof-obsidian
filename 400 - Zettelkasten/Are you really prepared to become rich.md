# Are you really prepared to become rich

Driven by inner calling instead of money. Money is just tool instead of goal.
Give yourself the time to prepare for the journey properly. Preparation means you keep studing, you keep training, you keep building skills long before anyone notices. When you chase luck without preparation, you are gambling not building.
When you break youself free from social signals and avoid crowded games, you start caring less about applause and more about inner peace, Your joy no longer comes from comparisons, it comes from creations. Engage in activities that bring you into a thoughtless state, where time dissolves and the mind quiets.
When you commit to something you truly love, something that calls to you even when no one is watching, you unlock a deeper resilience. You can endure failures because the work itself feeds you. You can keep going even when others quit because the fire is not external, it burns inside. Over time, this passion compounds. You will change your fate through your passion for the work you truly want to do, not the work society calls you to do.
