# Life is a self-fulfilling prophecy

**The direct way to attract luck is to trust yourself 200%.**  
Life is a self-fulfilling prophecy — your beliefs shape your behavior, and your behavior turns those beliefs into reality.

1. Always remind yourself: _“I deserve it.”_
2. Never waste your attention on things that haven’t happened yet — whether they’re two hours away or eight kilometers away. Calm your anxiety through action.
3. Don’t over-reflect on yourself. Once you develop a consistent style, the world will adapt to you. Focus on what you’ve learned, not on what you think you didn’t do well.

**Fake it until you make it.** The fastest way to grow is to face challenges head-on.
