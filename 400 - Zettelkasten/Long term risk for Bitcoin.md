# Long term risk for Bitcoin

**Long-term risks for Bitcoin include:**
1. **Quantum computing**
2. **Security budget**

Since miners can choose whether or not to follow Bitcoin protocol upgrades, adopting an anti-quantum upgrade would likely render their existing mining machines obsolete. That makes it difficult for Bitcoin to transition smoothly to quantum-resistant cryptography.

The **security budget problem** arises because Bitcoin’s block rewards keep halving over time. As rewards shrink, miners may find it unprofitable to continue operating and eventually shut down their machines. This would reduce the network’s hashrate, lowering security and making a 51% attack easier to execute.
