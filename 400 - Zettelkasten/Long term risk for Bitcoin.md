# Long term risk for Bitcoin

Long term risk for Bitcoin is:
1. quantum computing
2. security budget

Since minner can choose whether follow bitcoin protocol's upgrade, and accept upgrade for anti quantum computing will make machines they own become useless, it's difficult for Bitcoin to upgratde to anti quantum computing.

Security budget problem means when halving continues in the following years, minner's will be difficult to get profit, they will choose to shut down at some moment, and the hashrate for the bitcoin network will decrease. And it becomes easier for the attacker to issue 51% attack.
