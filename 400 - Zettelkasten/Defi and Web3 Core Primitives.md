# Defi and Web3 Core Primitives

Primitives:
- AMM
- Lending
- Stablecoin
- wETH
- Stacking
- Perps
- Flash Loan
- Oracles
- Vaults
- Aggregators
- CDPs
- Restacking

Actions:
- Build a stablecoin from scratch 
- Build uniswap v2 from scratch 
- Build the evm from scratch 
- Read everything on rareskills 
- Do hackathons 
- Study great protocols 
- Tweet about what you build 
- Deploy on chain 
- Build a simple frontend for your contracts
- read Morpho
- master foundry
- learn prediction market

The core is not solidity. Please don't learn syntax. Learn core EVM concepts, smart contract design patterns, and O(1) algorithms. Read EIPs, audit reports, and exploit post-mortems. Study basic cryptography, key management, and established DeFi protocols.

Play CTFs, Study real exploits(SCH), Share your journey


Read the theory first, Understand the protocol, read the fkn code and build using this.
