# Education on AI Era

**In the AI era, a paradigm shift is also happening in education.**  
We should prioritize **foundational skills** like mathematics, history, economics, and even science fiction over rote memorization and repetitive homework. Spending more time on **outdoor sports** is equally important — it strengthens both body and mind, qualities that AI can’t replace in a tech-driven future. Don’t force yourself to fit into an **obsolete system**.

The real problem with education in mainland China is that it **destroys children’s curiosity** about learning. Many students end up losing interest so deeply that they only play video games and disengage completely from study once they enter university. This happens because their natural curiosity was exhausted by years of meaningless homework and endless exams.

The time when you can gain the most from studying is when you’re **not studying for exams**. Never lose your curiosity during that stage of life. The most precious human traits — curiosity, attention, taste, physical vitality, and mental resilience — **cannot be measured by tests**.  
So play when you’re young. **Seize real moments of growth instead of chasing grades.**

青春短暂且珍贵，相比之下整个人生漫长的多。而中国的教育系统，就像是要在短暂的青春中消耗掉整个人生里对于学习的好奇心。这种方式从未正确过，在 AI 时代更是错的离谱。这种模式本质上就是要把人培异化成工具。真正有价值的东西：体格，心态，逻辑，认知。


找到自己感兴趣的东西； 然后顺着自己的兴趣玩下去； 不要让任何人定义自己的未来。很多人到了中年啊，那个死气沉沉的样子，做什么都提不起劲来，就是这一辈子都在做的自己不感兴趣的事情。 东亚的家庭和学校教育的毒鸡汤，就是告诉你智商和考试很重要，兴趣爱好这种能给人带来满足和快乐的事情不重要。一个人强烈的爱好，动力比博士学位还管用。兴趣是起点，是对抗困难和枯燥的最大力量。
