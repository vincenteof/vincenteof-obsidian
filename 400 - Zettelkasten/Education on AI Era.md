# Education on AI Era

**In the AI era, a paradigm shift is also happening in education.**  
We should prioritize **foundational skills** like mathematics, history, economics, and even science fiction over rote memorization and repetitive homework. Spending more time on **outdoor sports** is equally important — it strengthens both body and mind, qualities that AI can’t replace in a tech-driven future. Don’t force yourself to fit into an **obsolete system**.

The real problem with education in mainland China is that it **destroys children’s curiosity** about learning. Many students end up losing interest so deeply that they only play video games and disengage completely from study once they enter university. This happens because their natural curiosity was exhausted by years of meaningless homework and endless exams.

The time when you can gain the most from studying is when you’re **not studying for exams**. Never lose your curiosity during that stage of life. The most precious human traits — curiosity, attention, taste, physical vitality, and mental resilience — **cannot be measured by tests**.  
So play when you’re young. **Seize real moments of growth instead of chasing grades.**

青春短暂且珍贵，相比之下整个人生漫长的多。而中国的教育系统，就像是要在短暂的青春中消耗掉整个人生里对于学习的好奇心。这种方式从未正确过，在 AI 时代更是错的离谱。这种模式本质上就是要把人培异化成工具，让你用牛马般的努力麻痹自己，放弃面对真实的世界。真正有价值的东西：体格，心态，逻辑，认知。
