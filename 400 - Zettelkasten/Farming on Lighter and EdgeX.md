# Farming on Lighter and EdgeX

The points campaign is black-box in lighter, but people in community find some clue.
Action in lighter has its weight:
Time > Pair > Liquidation > Volume
Some a big position with long time gets more points.

While it's more straight forward in EdgeX, about 50000 volume per point. Adding funds to its vault also gets points.

Maybe I will use more EdgeX after BP season2 ends and adjust my strategy to reduce loss in season3.
