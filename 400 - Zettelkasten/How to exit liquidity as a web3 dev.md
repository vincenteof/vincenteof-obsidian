# How to exit liquidity as a web3 dev

First you lanuch a project, then you can transfer the money in contract to your EOA account. But without something like tornado cash, you are easy to be found.

Another way is to transfer money to some market maker account, or just a dex pool of some low-liquidity meme token. You can buy the token in advance, after the money from your project in, the price of the meme token will be much higher, now you can exit your liquidity.
