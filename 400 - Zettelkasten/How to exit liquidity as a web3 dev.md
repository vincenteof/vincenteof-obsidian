# How to exit liquidity as a web3 dev

First you lanuch a project, then you can transfer the money from contract to your EOA account. But without something like tornado cash, you are easy to be found.

Another approach is to move the fund to some market maker's account, or even to a dex pool of some low-liquidity meme token. You can buy the token in advance, once the money from your project flows into, the price of the meme token will rise significantly. At that time you can exit your liquidity.
