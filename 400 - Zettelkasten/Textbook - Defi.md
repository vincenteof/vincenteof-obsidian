# Defi Book

I generate a defi book using chatgpt, and I store it on notion. I will read it and do some labs on it.

- [ ] Defi Book Chapter2  #active 
Exercises:
2. Since blockchain is a distributed network, nodes should agree on the network state. 
3. In POW, a new node is created by minners, they compete with the minning puzzle to get the right to crate a new block. While in POS, the node creating the new block is random picked from stakers.
4. The one who created a new block will get reward, which is newly minted token. So they must back up with some scarity. In POW, the sacrity is hashing power, or energy. While in POS, the scarity is the staked token.
5. For POW, the attacker must hold over 51% hashing power. While the attacker must hold over 2/3 token in a POS system.
6. One angle is environment friendness. POW will waste a lot of energy because of the minning puzzle while POS is not. And POS is more friendly for long-term security budget. Minners will get less and less reward because of the halving, and so minner may shut down in some pio
