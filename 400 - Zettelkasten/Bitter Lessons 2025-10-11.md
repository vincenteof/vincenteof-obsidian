# Bitter Lessons 2025-10-11

- [x] bitter lessons from big liquidation caused by trump ✅ 2025-10-12

I was farming on BP and Lighter, and my BTC position (around **$10,000**) was liquidated following **Trump’s tweet about raising tariffs on China**.  
Although my position was **hedged**, I still lost money due to **liquidation fees and slippage**.

Looking back, I realize I was **too optimistic**, influenced by my recent good PnL, and became **blind to the inherent risks** of the financial market.  
The total loss was around **$7,000**, though I managed to reduce it slightly. I had previously set a rule for myself: _never use non-USD collateral for overnight positions_ — but I **failed to follow it**.

The market is **unpredictable**, and you should always assume your position could **drop more than 20% overnight**.  
I also need to **rethink the allocation** between my stock and crypto investments. The crypto market is inherently fragile, and perhaps the best long-term strategy is simply **stacking BTC and ETH**.

Key Lessons Learned:
1. **Never use non-USD collateral** for overnight positions when farming on perpetuals.
2. **Always assume** the market could dump 20% overnight — and set proper **risk controls** accordingly.
3. **Margin is fragile** in crypto farming: profits are limited, but risks are unlimited.
4. **Rebalance your portfolio** — focus on strong crypto assets, and consider **stacking BTC and ETH** based on their **FDV ratio**.
