# Bitter Lessons 2025-10-11

- [ ] bitter lessons from big liquidation caused by trump

I farmed on BP and Ligther and my position (about 10k USD BTC) was liquidated because of Trump's tweet about raising tariff on China again. Although my position is hedged I still lost money because of liquidation fee and slippage.
I think I was over opimistic because of my PNL is good recent times and being blind to the risky nature of the financial market.
The total loss is about 7000 USD and I was able to reduce it. I told myself never use non USD collateral with over-night position but I didn't obey the rule.
The market is non-predictable and you should always assume that your position will dump over 20% over night.
And I should rethink about my ratio of investment between stock and cryptocurrency. Crypto market seems fragile and maybe the best strategy is only stacking BTC and ETH.
