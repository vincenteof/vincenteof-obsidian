# Will BMNR and SBET sell Ether

They don't need to sell Ether in most cases. Because most of their fund are raised by selling their stocks instead of issueing debts. They can copy MSTR, in bear market, the mNav may be under 1, they could issue debts, like convertible debts to buy Ether and repay the debts when the market goes well, simplying bu ATM when mNav is higher than 1.
