# Will BMNR and SBET sell Ether

They don't need to sell Ether in most cases. Because most of their fund are currently raised by selling equity rather than issuing debts. They can follow MSTR's play book: during a bear market, the mNav might fall bellow 1, they could issue debts, such as convertible bonds to buy Ether. Later, when the market improves and mNav raise above 1, they can repay the dept simply by ATM.
