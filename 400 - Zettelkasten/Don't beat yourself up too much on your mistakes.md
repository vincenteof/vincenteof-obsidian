# Don't beat yourself up too much on your mistakes

"Everyone makes mistakes. I think people beat themselves up too much over their mistakes.” — Warren Buffett

I hope that I could  be calm each time I make mistakes, focusing analyzing the root cause instead of self punishment. Obsessing over mistakes only wastes time and energy.
