# Valuation for NVDA

- [ ] read the report by AI to get a rough idea #active

Since all the LLM company hasn't make profit, NVDA is the one captured most value in this AI cycle. It almost monopolizes the market of AI training on cloud. In short, it's the company selling the computing power.

possible risk:
1. big company are pursuing more intelligence from more computing power, when will the scaling law reachs its limit? Another similar pivot point, when AI is more excellent than human being on every field, there is no need to improve.
2. If no one make real profit from AI, then demand for computing power descreases.
3. Paradigm shift on computing power, like quantum computer or other ASIC rather than common GPU.

For 1, I don't see the trend that demand for GPU decreases, all the giant companies are developing new multimodal models.
