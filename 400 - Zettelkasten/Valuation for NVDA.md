# Valuation for NVDA

- [x] read the report by AI to get a rough idea #active ✅ 2025-10-16

Since all the LLM company hasn't make profit, NVDA is the one captured most value in this AI cycle. It almost monopolizes the market of AI training on cloud. In short, it's the company selling the computing power. It's a platform for general-purpose parallel computing. The product it sells are
1. GPU
2. CUDA development ecosystem
3. AI software and framework
4. business service
Currently, there are mainly three parts occupy the income of NVDA:
- Tranning - 60~65%
- Inference - 20~25%
- Other - 10~15%
Income from AI tranning is the most, but the demand of inference is increasing sharply.

potential risk:
1. big company are pursuing more intelligence from more computing power, when will the scaling law reachs its limit? Another similar pivot point, when AI is more excellent than human being on every field, there is no need to improve.
2. If no one make real profit from AI, then demand for computing power descreases.
3. Paradigm shift on computing power, like quantum computer or other ASIC rather than common GPU.

For 1, I don't see the trend that demand for GPU decreases, all the giant companies are developing new multimodal models. Once model is trainned, the demand for training still exist, since there will be finetuning for specific domain. Once the model war is finished, there will only be one or two winner, at that the deman for training will decrease.
For 2, AI do have taken some jobs and seems promising, and whether it can really change the world will be seen in next 1 or 2 years.
For 3, there are some trend like quantum computing or photonic computing, but they are all at a very experimental stage. And they don't have ecosystem which means it will take very long time eat the shares. Another risk maybe ASIC and it's more practical.
