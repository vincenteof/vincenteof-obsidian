# Bitter lessons recently

First lesson is learning during farming Spark points. I hedged using perp before I got the airdrop and I didn't notice the high negative funding rate (200%). Even if the price keep unchanged I am still losing money. Even worse, a short squeeze occurred afterwards. I surrendered after losing about $3000 because I have no more .
