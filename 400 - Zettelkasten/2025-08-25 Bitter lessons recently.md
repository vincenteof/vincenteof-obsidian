First lesson is learned during farming Spark points. I hedged on perp before I got the airdrop and I didn't notice the high negative funding rate (approximately 200%). Even if the price keep unchanged I am still losing money. Even worse, a short squeeze occurred afterwards. In then I was forced to surrender because I have no more margin and I lost 3000 USD.
The lesson is:
1. Pick projects which seems reliable. In that case we don't need to hedge because the token can be viewd as call option even its price go down after
