I hedged on SPK perp before I got the airdrop and I didn't notice the high negative funding rate (approximately 200%). Even if the price keep unchanged I am still losing money. Even worse, a short squeeze occurred afterwards. In the end I was forced to surrender because I have no more margin and I lost 3000 USD. The lessons are:
1. Pick projects which seems reliable. In that case we don't need to hedge because the token can be viewd as call option even its price go down after airdrop. All tough issues like when to hedge, how much to hedge, at which prices to SL, don't even exist.
2. When you really need to hedge, observe the funding rate, make a detailed plan, matain enough margin.
After I got the airdrop, I made a mistake in staking it and missed a good selling price. The root cause is I was so excited and too eager to TP. The lesson is:
3. Slow is fast. Operate with care.
A related mistake is when I was in a hurry to drive out and accidentally hit the car beside. Maybe there is some deep pyschological resons. Since I was a child I've always been scared of falling behind. So whenever things don't go the way I planned, I jsut want to rap them quickly to avoid people talking about me.


Other mistake is happened during farming the perp dex points and is more trival. I got liquidated in BP because I didn't undestand some details in spot leverage while  my hedge postion is still alive in lighter, which leads to my losses. The worse part is this kind of mistakes happened several times in these days. The lessons are:
1. Be careful when using non-usd collateral in spot leverage trading in BP
2. Always set TP/SL prices avoiding one leg position
