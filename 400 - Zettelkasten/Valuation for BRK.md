BRK consists of 3 core parts:
1. insurance business providing cheap float money
2. investment portflio focusing on blue chip stocks
3. private sub companies
4. about 300B cash to buy back or buyout

Its philosophy is:
1. only make long-term positive ev investment
2. let the company they buyout run independently
3. buy when other are fear and sell when other are greedy
4. prefer compound profit to fast profit

PB is better than PE for BRK, 1.4 - 1.6 is reasonable and 1.3 is good buying time. On 2025/10/30, it is 1.55.

As a long term investor, we should focus on the following potential risk:
1. Shift from Buffet to Abel, and Todd Combs/Ted Weschler will continue on investment
2. The cycle of insurance business
3. If AI is the real future, whether they could still find their way
4. How it can beat the market when in such a big size
