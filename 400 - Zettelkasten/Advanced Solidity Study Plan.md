# Advanced Solidity Study Plan

I am trying to generate a textbook on Solidity, but the quality is not so good. 
So I pivot to good material in the community.

- [x] play with the first 5 exercises #active ✅ 2025-09-16
- [x] play with CodeSize, CrossContract, Decoder, DeployContract exercises #active ✅ 2025-09-18
- [x] play with Deployer, Distribute, DistributeV2, Divide, Donations #active ✅ 2025-09-19
- [x] play with Emitter, Encoder, Enum, EverythingWorks, Exponent #active ✅ 2025-09-22
- [x] play with Fibonacci, FilterOddNumbers, FizzBuzz, IdiotBetting, IfStatement #active ✅ 2025-09-29
- [x] play with Immutable, InheritanceOverride, InsertInArray, IsPrime, IsSorted #active ✅ 2025-10-15

Questions:
1. How to prevent [Block Timestamp Manipulation](https://solidity-by-example.org/hacks/block-timestamp-manipulation/) using zk?
2. Implement an ERC20 token supports  `permit` operation
3. precision related issues like fractional representation and calculation, and its related security topic
4. How ERC20 staking works

Differences:
1. memory array can only be fixed, storage array can be dynamic
