# Advanced Solidity Study Plan

I am trying to generate a textbook on Solidity, but the quality is not so good. 
So I pivot to good material in the community.

- [x] play with the first 5 exercises #active ✅ 2025-09-16
- [x] play with CodeSize, CrossContract, Decoder, DeployContract exercises #active ✅ 2025-09-18
- [ ] play with Deployer, Distribute, DistributeV2, Divide, Donations

Questions:
1. How to prevent [Block Timestamp Manipulation](https://solidity-by-example.org/hacks/block-timestamp-manipulation/) using zk?
