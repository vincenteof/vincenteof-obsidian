# Avoid Widom-Maker Strategy

Avoid strategy like looping. This kind of strategy requires high leverage or big position, and profit is limited but the risk is unlimited. It looks safe that each day you receive some yields, but you will loss all your money when black swan comes.
Always assume that market will dump 20% over night, will you survive in the mess?
I think the ultimate goal of investment is freedom, and if you do it like work, there must something wrong. If it's really inevitable, try to automate it.
Some rules to obey:
1. Place your cash in safe place. For fiat, in bank or buy something like T-Bill. For crypto, place it on binance or wallet. Avoid high yield trap.
2. Several good stock and BTC/ETH is enough for your goal, you don't need so many targets.
3. Don't use margin.
4. Automate the trival work.
