# Valuation for TSLA

TSLA use synthesis to simulate edge cases, a world model for vison based fsd.

## Basic

The goal: **sustianable abundnace**
Basically they want to eliminate the scarity through technology revolution. The scarity could be energy, labor force, time. In order to make all things scalable, the cost must be low enough and the production efficiency must be high.
Optimus -> Infinite labor force supply with intelligence
FSD -> free time with more safety, Car becomes asset creating cash flow, the cost of transportation reuducing to near zero
Energy storage -> sun as the infinite energy supply


Elon is trying to put 100GW/year of AI in space. Basically they are gonna deploy GPUs into orbit.

Hand is very complex and its the core of robot which intends to do a surgery or build a house. This kind of demand cannot be solved by money because these kind of resources(good surgeon) is limited.

The sentience will grow when new Grok is trainned. The question is how far it can go? Elon thinks almost incomprehensibly far. Elon sees a path putting 100 gw per year of solar powered AI satellite into orbit as a solution to scale AI.





## Energy

因为 AI 数据中心的能耗波动极大，有可能从 10％ 飙升到 100％。这种“尖峰+高频震荡”会严重冲击当地电网，可能导致电压骤降、频率失稳，甚至大面积停电。Megapack 可以充当缓冲期，只需要数据中心成本的 1％ 就可以完全平滑这种波动。
## FSD
- [ ] read fsd long post

## Milestone

FSD:
1. size scale (2000 robotaxi)
2. when remove the security officer (by the end of 2025)
3. when will FSD allow driver to use the phone (by the end of 2025)
