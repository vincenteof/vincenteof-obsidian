The goal: **sustianable abundnace**
Basically they want to eliminate the scarity through technology revolution. The scarity could be energy, labor force, time. In order to make all things scalable, the cost must be low enough and the production efficiency must be high.
Optimus -> Infinite labor force supply with intelligence
FSD -> free time with more safety, Car becomes asset creating cash flow, the cost of transportation reuducing to near zero
Energy storage -> sun as the infinite energy supply
