# Several Options about Parenting

1. Attention is rare resource, never give your kid infinite trivial  tasks. This is also true for adults.
2. Be the only one instead of being the better one.
3. Formal education will make you a living, self-education will make you a fortune. The problem is, you cannot earn a living by formal education currently. You must learn "vibe learning".
4. Let the kid learn how social structure and power works, figuring out the truth about money, society, Institution. Never train him a tool man.
5. It's very similar like the fist point. You should let your child focus on enhancing his mental model instead of give him infinite trivial tasks.
