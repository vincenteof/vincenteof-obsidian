# Valuation for BRK
- [x] learn the basic of brk #active ✅ 2025-11-01

## Basic
BRK consists of 3 core parts:
1. insurance business providing cheap float money
2. investment portflio focusing on blue chip stocks
3. private sub companies
4. about 300B cash to buy back or buyout

Its philosophy is:
1. only make long-term positive ev investment
2. let the company they buyout run independently
3. buy when other are fear and sell when other are greedy
4. prefer compound profit to fast profit

PB is better than PE for BRK, 1.4 - 1.6 is reasonable and 1.3 is good buying time. On 2025/10/30, it is 1.55.

As a long term investor, we should focus on the following potential risk:
1. Shift from Buffet to Abel, and Todd Combs/Ted Weschler will continue on investment
2. The status of insurance business
3. If AI is the real future, whether they could still find their way
4. How it can beat the market when in such a big size

## Leadership

Todd 与 2025/12/08 宣布离职。Todd 与 Ted 分别掌握 15B 的资金，约占 BRK 总证券资产的 10％～15％。他们更像现代化的巴菲特，对科技公司更开放。
Todd 对保险和金融理解比较深且投资更分散保守，Ted 集中度更高更大的 conviction，Abel 可能更关注实业。
Todd 与 Ted 各掌握约 150 亿美元，合计 ~300 亿，是 BRK 投资端的“未来样板间”。Todd 风格偏保守、偏金融、重风险控制；Ted 偏集中、偏深度研究、偏长期成长。Todd 离职后，证券投资端。将更集中于 Ted，一定程度增加波动性，但仍在 Berkshire 可控框架下。
