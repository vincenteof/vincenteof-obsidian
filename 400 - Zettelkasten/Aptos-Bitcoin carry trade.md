# Aptos-Bitcoin carry trade

1. first you set "Auto Lend" on
2. then you borrow BTC since BTC has the lowest interest rate, by selling BTC/USD and  activating "Margin"
3. then you lend APT since APT has the highest interest rate, by placing a "Buy" order on APT/USD and activating "Margin"
4. now you already set up the carry trade, but it's not delta neutral, since you short BTC and long APT, you could hedge these two sides using perp, but the funding rate is uncontrollable
